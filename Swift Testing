// Is this a comment?
print("I guess so.")
//Now to explore Swift:

let num: Int = 10 // This is a constant, and cannot be changed
print(num)

var variable: Int = 9 //This si a var, so you can change it
print(variable)
variable = variable - 7
print(variable)

var words: String = "Hello" //This is a string
print(words)
words += " my name is Joeseph"+"!"
print(words)

let coordinates: (Int,Int) = (2, 3) //This is a  a Tuple
print(coordinates.0)
let y = coordinates.1

let coordinates3D = (x: 2, y: 3, z: 1) //Inferred as ints
let (x, y, z) = coordinates3D // This makes 3 constants, x,y, and z

let (x, y, _) = coordinates3D // This ignores a value, an _ is used for this
